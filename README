Bootstrap Slider

By using the widget factory pattern from Jquery UI, we can have on top of github the core functionality in order to create our extend functionality to Bootstrap.

This humble extension provides a way to make the built in progress bar into a slider.

All required javascript and css files are found in this repository's html files. Please read along Bootstrap Progress found at http://getbootstrap.com/components/#progress

To update a progress bar you need to include data-slider into your element
<div class="progress" data-slider="true">...</div>

The slider makes use of aria-* attributes from the the progress bar

<div class="progress" data-slider="true">
      <div aria-valuemax="100" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuenow="30" role="progressbar" class="progress-bar">
          <span class="sr-only">60%</span>
      </div>
</div>

If you would like to do it at runtime, it works this way.

$p = $(".progress);
$p.slider({max:100, min:0, now:30} );


There are two events dispatched by $p, sliderchange and slidercomplete

$p.on( "sliderchange", function(e,result){
    console.log( "action: " + result.action + ", value: " + result.value );
});

$p.on( "slidercomplete", function(e,result){
    console.log( 'slider completed!' );
});

result is an object having action and value. Action tells how the slider updated graphically the thumbbar. 'init' when the slider has just being created, 'drag' when the user is shifting the slider, 'set' when the value was assigned via javascript.

value is the current value also modified at aria-valuenow.

In order to update via javascript we do the following
$p.slider( "option", "now", value );

We can also update min and max in the same way. Make sure in this case to refresh the slider doing the following:
$p.slider( "refresh" );

This extension was tested on Android phone, Android tablet and touchscreen desktop. So under those conditions, it works for cursor and finger gesture.
